# What is this?

This repository contain my final year projects in High School. Build using PHP (I don't even remember which version lol I made these in 2013 - 2014), Jquery, and database MySQL.

Uploading here to remind me that I shed my sweat and tears in highschool to finish these projects and I don't want it to lost or corrupted in my hard drive.

There are 2 projects, UApotik.com in first semester and Athena in second semester.

# How To Run

Ugh, I really forgot how to run these in local, I guess we need to install PHPMyAdmin and import the database there. And we need a web browser that still support Flash too (some of the component still using Flash).
